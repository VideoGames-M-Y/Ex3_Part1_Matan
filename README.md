Part 1 of the weekly task by Matan

**Upgraded the game from class:**

3. When the spaceship crosses the left or right screen boundaries it emerges from the other side ("round world") but blocked from the upper and lower boundaries.

4. The spaceship has health points that can be lost from enemies and can be gained from floating medkits.

*Original:** When an enemy dies- it explodes.
